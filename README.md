# Thodi on Trading

## Introduction

This is my blog where I share my experiences, lessons and the knowledge that I learn on my journey becoming a financial analyst, trader and investor.

The blog is hosted at [blog.miyanda.org](https://blog/miyanda.org). It is built with [Ed](http://minicomp.github.io/ed/); a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme designed for textual editors based on [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) principles, and focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility.

If you like the way the blog looks and would like to use it, please visit the [Ed documentation page](http://minicomp.github.io/ed/documentation) to learn how to install and use it.
